# BigCommerce Storefront Data Hooks

> This project is under active development, new features and updates will be continuously added over time

UI hooks and data fetching methods built from the ground up for e-commerce applications written in React, that use BigCommerce as a headless e-commerce platform. The package provides:

- Code splitted hooks for data fetching using [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/), and to handle common user actions
- Code splitted data fetching methods for initial data population and static generation of content
- Helpers to create the API endpoints that connect to the hooks, very well suited for Next.js applications

While we're missing the docs, you can check how the package works in a live demo: [demo.vercel.store](https://demo.vercel.store/) ([repo](https://github.com/vercel/commerce))
